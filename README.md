# TheGameStation
This is my first website that I have built for a new, local business. It is roughly 90% complete with a few tweaks to be made and a refactor of my code. I am also waiting on more content from my client and the instruction to go live with the site. I used the skills I picked up from my online learning to build this site from mostly HTML and CSS with a little help from Bootstrap including some JavaScript/jQuery.

Please use this link to view the (unfinished) site - https://wwilsonnorth.github.io/TheGameStation/
