### TheGameStation - https://wwilsonnorth.github.io/TheGameStation/

This is my first one-page website that I built for a new, local business. Having been given no direction as to how the client wanted the site to look, I have changed the layout and style of this page several times when creating it.

Initially, I started the project early in my learning process so used a large amount of Bootstrap that later caused issues when I tried customising some of the styles. On 10/06/20, I rebuilt the entire website from the ground up removing Bootstrap entirely and using skills I had picked up from online courses I had completed. Since then, I have played around with a few other features in my spare time and drawn out plans for future content to add when the client has provided me with more images and written content that I can add.

Unfortunately due to the pandemic, they haven't been able in the position to take any bookings thus the website is in no rush to be completed which has allowed me to take my time to play around with the design and functionality.
