# TheGameStation
This is my first one-page website that I built for a new, local business. I originally created this site using what I had learnt from an online course where I used a large amount of Bootstrap that later caused issues in terms of making the site responsive and customising some of the styles. From 10/06/20, I rebuilt the entire website from the ground up. Having learnt more since I first worked on this site, I removed Bootstrap entirely and created everything using vanilla CSS (and a small bit of jQuery). The website is now ready to go as soon as my client has provided me with team images and the instruction to go live.
